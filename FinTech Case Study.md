* Actico's target clients range all the way from small and mid-sized firms all the way to Fortune 500 companies.
* Actico utilizes their machine learning technology to keep financial and insurance companies up to date with their compliance to ever changing regulations. Instead of having to wait for tyhe next version of software to have the newest regulations in the software, Actico's on the fly changes keep companies up to date with the latest regulations.
